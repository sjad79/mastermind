# ðŸŽ® Mastermind Console Game in C++

A compact C++ implementation of the classic Mastermind game, designed for terminal play. The player must guess a secret 4-digit code (each digit from 1â€“6), receiving hints after each attempt:

- `O` â†’ Correct digit in the correct position  
- `#` â†’ Correct digit but in the wrong position

The game continues until all digits and positions are correctly guessed. Ideal for practicing arrays, loops, input handling, and logic-building in C++.
